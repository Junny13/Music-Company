# Music-Company

This application is a system for a music production company, which is divided into two categories: the Admin Page and the Customer Page.
The database is driven by these two categories, in which the administrator (admin) can edit and delete contents from the database and more specifically can add new songs, singers, albums and concerts. In addition, the administrator as well as the customer can view the singers, their albums and the songs in each album, along with other data in the database, such as sales and costs of the albums and their songs. 
Finally, the application provides the ability to search for the singer, albums and songs of each artist. The functionality and elements of the database as well as the functionality of the application is discussed in the pdf file.
